Checkout the [Nuxt3 docs](https://nuxt.com/docs)
and [Nuxt2 docs](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/) for more information.[^1]

[^1]: Nuxt 2 docs offer better examples and and interactive guides,
      but obviously are not up to date with everything new Nuxt 3
      (and, generally, much of nuxt 2 is still present in Nuxt 3
      so there's useful stuff to be got there).
