Using a position-based system with constraints (instead of the more common mass-spring model)
to simulate bodies. The method, as described in
[this paper](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf),
offers several advantages over the mass-spring model
including being more generalizable to other scenarios and
requiring less computation to simulate a body.
