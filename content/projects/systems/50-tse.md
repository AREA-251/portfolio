A hyper-efficient [search engine][search-engine]
that crawls webpages (whose domain can be restricted
to a given subset) and indexes them,
then handles user queries on the contents of the collection of pages,
with results ranked by frequency.
It also supports query modifiers such as AND, OR,
and NOT.
