Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot topic, especially recently.
This uptick in public interest in AI is driven by the improved capabilities of
deep learning architectures such transformers.
The emergent capabilities of such models such as GPT
have immense utility in other fields.
But this also leaves many professionals in those fields anxious about their jobs.
The ethicality of deploying AI models in critical, user-facing applications where
errorneous predictions have real-world consequences is also a concern &mdash;
a faction of industry leaders has even called for a blanket pause to AI experiments
until a proper regulations framework is put in place. to avoid the risk of runaway AI.

This research project studies the societal attitudes toward AI, both currently
and how they have evolved over the years,
as a way to understand how different events have shaped the public's perception of AI.
We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and procrustes analysis
to analyze relationships across time periods and extract insight
into the changing story of artificial intelligence.
