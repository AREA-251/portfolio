Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a hot topic, especially in light of
recent improvements in its capabilities.
This research project studies the societal attitudes toward AI,
both present and how they have evolved over the years,
as a way to understand how different events have
shaped the public's perception of AI.
We use topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and procrustes analysis
to analyze relationships across time periods and extract insight
into the changing story of artificial intelligence.
Here's the [studied dataset][dataset] and the [project report][report].

Collaborative project with [Aimen Abdulaziz][aimen] and [Angelic McPherson][angelic].
