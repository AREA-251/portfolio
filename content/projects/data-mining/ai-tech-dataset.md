I wrote a high-performant web scraper
in Haskell to scrape 17000+ articles from
online technology websites such as
[DeepMind][deepmind],
[MIT Tech Review][mit-tech-review]
[OpenAI][openai],
[Singularity Hub][singuilarity-hub], and
[TechCrunch][tech-crunch]

The scraper uses [Arrows][arrows] and other functional programming
patterns to ensure concurrency and efficiency.
The dataset is open-source and available on [HuggingFace][huggingface].

Collaborative project with [Aimen Abdulaziz][aimen-abaziz] and [Angelic McPherson][angelic-mcpherson].
