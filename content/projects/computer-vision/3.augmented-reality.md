Experimentation with using planar homographies to overlay images on top of
other images. The goal is to create an augmented reality effect by
transforming the perspective of the overlay image to match the perspective
of the background image.  
Techiniques implemented include:

- Image feature descriptors, such as [BRIEF][brief] and [ORB][orb], for
  detecting and describing keypoints in images.
- [RANSAC algorithm][ransac] for estimating the homography
  between two images.
- [Perspective Transform][perspective] for transforming the perspective of
  an image to match the perspective of another image.
