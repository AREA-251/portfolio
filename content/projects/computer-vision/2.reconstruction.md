Experimentation with different techniques for 3D reconstruction of a
scene using multiple images taken at slightly different angles.  
Techiniques implemented include:

- [Sparse reconstruction][sparse] to estimate the 3D structure
  of a scene from a set of 2D images.
- [Epipolar geometry][epipolar] to identify corresponding points
  in different images.
- [Triangulation][triangulation] to estimate the 3D position of
  a point in space given its position in multiple images.
- [Bundle adjustment][bundle] to refine the 3D reconstruction by
  minimizing the reprojection error.
