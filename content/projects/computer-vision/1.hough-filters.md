Experimentation with using convolutions and hough transforms
to detect lines and corners in images.  
Techiniques implemented include:

- [Harris Corner Detection][harris], a method for detecting corners in images
  by identifying regions with high variation in intensity in both the x and y
  directions.
- [Hough Line Transform][hough], a method for detecting lines in images by
  mapping points in the image space to lines in the hough space.
  Lines are detected by finding intersections in the hough space.
- [Gaussian Smoothing][gaussian], a method for reducing noise in images by
  applying a gaussian filter to the image.
- [Sobel Operator][sobel], a method for calculating the gradient of an image
  by convolving the image with a pair of 3x3 kernels.
