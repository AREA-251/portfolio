Experimentation with different techniques for tracking **optical flow**
in a video sequence. Optical flow is the apparent motion of objects,
either due to the motion of the objects themselves or the motion of the
camera.  
Techiniques implemented include:

- [Lucas-Kanade method][lucas] for estimating optical flow by
  assuming that the flow is constant in a local neighborhood.
- [Lucas-Kanade inverse-compositional method][inverse] for estimating
  optical flow by assuming that the flow is constant in a local
  neighborhood and that the flow is smooth across the image.
- [Matthews-Baker inverse-compositional method][matthews] for estimating optical flow by
  assuming that the flow is constant in a local neighborhood and
  that the flow is smooth across the image.
