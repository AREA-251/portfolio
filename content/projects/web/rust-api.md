It is straightforward to build a REST API in [TypeScript][ts] using [Express][express].
As a proof-of-concept for an upcoming project, I tried out
building a REST API in [Rust][rust] using [Rocket][rocket].
Rust is advantageous since it offers C-like performance
without the associated memory safety issues.
The API has a database backend using [MongoDB][mongo].

_This project is part of a bigger personal project that's in the works &mdash; stay tuned!_
