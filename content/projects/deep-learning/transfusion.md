For fun, I implemented the [Generative Pre-trained Transformer][gpt] (GPT) architecture
in PyTorch. GPT is a language model that uses a transformer architecture
to generate text. I trained the model on the [tiny Shakespeare dataset][tinyshakes]
and used it to generate text in the style of Shakespeare.
