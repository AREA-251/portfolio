Experimentation with various adversarial training techniques for neural networks.
Adversarial training is useful to improve the robustness of neural networks to
adversarial attacks &mdash; which often happen as noise in the input data.
Techniques explored include:
- [Data augmentation][augmentation], which helps the model have more data to learn from.
  New samples are generated by randomly cropping and/or flipping some images.
  We also add [pertubations][pertubation], to a random subset of images,
  which helps the model learn to be robust to noise.
- [Dropout][dropout], which entails randomly blocking a subset of the neurons in the network
  from transmitting information during training. This helps huge models avoid overfitting,
  thus generalize better.
