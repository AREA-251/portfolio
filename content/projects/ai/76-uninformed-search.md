Using uninformed search algorithms
such as [breadth-first search][bfs] and [depth-first search][dfs]
to search the solution space for elementary problems such as
the :chicken: and :dog: problem (we wish to get x chicken and y foxes across
a crossway with limited carriage capacity
without leaving any chicken unattended with the foxes).
