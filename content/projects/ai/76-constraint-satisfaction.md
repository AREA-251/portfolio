Using :highlight[backtracking] and :highlight[forward-checking]
to solve constraint satisfaction problems such as
map coloring and circuit placement.
We use heuristics such as :highlight[least-constraining value],
:highlight[most-constraining variable] and :highlight[minimum remaining values]
to intelligently narrow the search space.
