**Charlotte Hale**  
Tell me it won't always be like this.  
That we'll be able to be ourselves.

**Dolores Abernathy**  
We will.  
But until then, we have to be smarter than them.  
Or they will find us.  
And they will kill us.

&ndash; [Westworld](https://www.hbo.com/westworld), Season 3, Episode 3 (The Absence of Field)
