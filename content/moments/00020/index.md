We often underestimate the stories that live in our hearts.
These stories that square our truth clearly to feelings unchanged by
time. We may reject these stories in fear of their pain, denying
rather than holding, or burying rather than revealing, in hopes
that they may fade or vanish entirely.
But such materials do not easily wane.
They may not disappear, lessen, or even age at all.
In the mechanics of the emotional landscape, these
stories may in fact grow, snowballing deeper down the valleys of
the psyche, in perpetual search of a shadow to call home.
Without acknowledgment, they persist, yet, undirected,
they remain lost.

When we intervene in these stories with an open curiosity, we shine light onto the
shape of their experience, uncovering memories as hope
belonging to meaning. We investigate our hidden language, a
literacy of strength in the knowing of one's truth. Our journey
extends outward beyond its previous reach, reclaiming direction
through destination and discovery. When we connect to the
untold stories we've buried, we release the pain of where we
began, to eventually reveal the story of where we might go.
