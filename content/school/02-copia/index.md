Copia re-imagines e-commerce for developing communities in East Africa
by providing solutions for the restrictions of the region,
such as ordering products via text message and paying via mobile money. 

At my time there:

- I developed a new widget for the Copia website that
  simplified the order-tracking process for orders
  made via text message.
- I also worked with the engineering team that maintained
  Copia's database and internal APIs.
  Technologies used included Python, Django, and PostgreSQL.

It was estimated that more than 80 per-cent of Copiaâ€™s
two-million customers ordered via text message
at least once a month.
