At the time, Meta was pivoting its machine learning strategy to be more efficient with limited data in light of cross-site tracking restrictions introduced by Apple in iOS 14.5.

To facilitate this transition;

- I prototyped a new concept for a closed-loop ML pipeline from Facebook and Instagram apps to internal data-stores, to machine learning workflows, and eventually relaying feedback to the apps.
- I developed a command-line and web utility (in C++ and PHP) for monitoring and controlling the data throughput of the ML pipeline.

The tool enabled machine learning engineers to fine-tune the data rates that they desired for their models, depending on scale of experimentation.
