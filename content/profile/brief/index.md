# About

Final-year student in computer science and mathematics at [Dartmouth College][dartmouth],
with particular interests in [deep learning][dl], [category theory][category-theory],
[functional programming][functional-prg], and [design][design].

As of July 2024, I will be joining [Meta][meta] as a software engineer,
working with the [Instagram][instagram] team to create new experiences
for its global user base.

I carry a keen sense of responsibility for my work,
across the entire data stack:

- [**Ethical and responsible data collection and warehousing.**]{style="color: white;"} :br :br
  Knowing what to collect, how, why, and most importantly
  how to respect user privacy and copyright issues where applicable
  is important. I have relevant experience and coursework in
  data mining and ethics therein. :br :br
  Proper warehousing, be it in data lakes or SQL/NoSQL databases, is also critical.
  I have experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases,
  and I am working to better understand the underlying architectures
  and implementations of SQL databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. :br :br
  I am also curious about vector databases and how the nuances they introduce
  to the data stack. :br :br

- [**Ethical analysis, interpretation and usage**.]{style="color: white;"} :br :br
  _We are in the age of AI_, indubitably.  
  I am interested in deep learning and the applications
  of novel neural network architectures, especially transformers,
  to real-world problems. I have experience working with neural networks
  (and other less interesting ML models!) in various application contexts,
  including computer vision, language understanding, robotics,
  and reinforcement learning. :br :br

- [**Presentation and use in production.**]{style="color: white;"} :br :br
  Much of anything is useful once it can be presented to an end user
  in a system designed and customized for their needs.
  I have experience and interests in both building front-end, user-facing
  applications and building back-ends to support them.
  I am experienced with both [React][react] and [Vue][vue],
  and their proxies (e.g. [Nuxt][nuxt], [Next][next], etc.). :br :br
  I also have experience building systems with a focus on
  efficiency and high performance (C, C++, Rust)
  and reliability (Rust, Haskell). :br :br

I am also working on some stuff I am excited about
over at [entendr][entendr] and
recently started learning [Racket][racket] because of
its [langauge-oriented development][lang-dev] features.
