My given name is [Amittai][amittai], but my preferred name ad 2022 is [Altair][altair].
I am a [Kenyan][kenya] student at [Dartmouth College][dartmouth]
where I am a dual major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

My primary interests in computer science are data engineering and deep learning,
but I am also interested in functional programming ([Haskell][haskell]?),
web development (Vue > React), graph algorithms (and graph neural networks),
and theory of computation.
I am currently learning theory of computation and computer vision.

My primary interests in mathematics are in abstract algebra, analysis, and logic,
but I also find the power of differential equations fascinating.

Beyond academics, find me playing chess, reading or writing,
shooting with my camera, or playing 
[Assassin's Creed][assassins-creed].

I have been an alumni / student at:
