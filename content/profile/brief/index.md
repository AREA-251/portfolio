# About

My primary interests are in [deep learning][dl], [category theory][category-theory] and [functional programming][functional-prg], and a _little bit_ of [design][design].
However, I love to problem-solve across a wide range of domains.

I love spending time crafting things, among them:

- Writing [long-form technical articles][blog] about mathematics
  and computer science.
- Writing [short-form technical articles][blog] about things I find funny.
- Writing [short-form non-technical articles][blog] about literature and art.
- Creating [generative art][art] with [p5.js][p5js].
- [Photography][insta-art], once in a while.
