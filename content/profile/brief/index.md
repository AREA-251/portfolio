# About

My primary interests are in [deep learning][dl], [category theory][category-theory] and [functional programming][functional-prg], and a _little bit_ of [design][design].
However, I love to problem-solve across a wide range of domains.

I love spending time crafting things&mdash;

- [Designing and building things][archive]!
- Writing [long-form technical articles][blog] about mathematics
  and computer science and short-form technical articles
  about things I find interesting, including _[math and computer science][blog]_
  and _[literature and art][blog]_.
- Creating [generative art][art] (with [p5.js][p5js]), and [shooting photos][insta-art] sometimes.
