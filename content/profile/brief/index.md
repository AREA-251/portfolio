# Hello There

<!-- 

Throughout my life, I've always put a lot of dedication and effort into everything that I did.
I think that that is important:
to put one's mind and effort into something and see how that effort5 equates to success.

I am a rising senior at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science and Mathematics. My primary interests are in deep learning,
systems engineering, cryptography, category theory, functional programming, and a little bit of design. I love to problem-solve across
a wide range of domains, and I am excited to learn about and work on challenging problems and discover new perspectives.
I am originally from Kenya. Having grown up in an environment with limited resources, I learned resourcefulness, resilience, and a keen
sense of responsibility. These are values I carry in all my activities, including engineering work. I love to iterate fast, but also acknowledge
the limitations that bootstrapped solutions might have when employed in real-world scenarios.
Why 2 𝜎?
I’m reciting that quality affects all aspects of my pursuits. I want to imbue quality in everything I do. This skill develops while doing. Not
thinking, not imagining, doing. It is acquired through learning and experimenting and consistency and pacing. I admire the impeccably
high bar of achievement at 2 𝜎, which would both challenge me to perform at the best of my abilities and inspire me to go beyond my
assumed limits in working around novel problems in the industry. Above all, 2 𝜎 will be instrumental in helping me grow intellectually,
hone my skills, and develop the appetite for risk that is required to make real-world impact.

## Who?

:styled-image

I'm [Amittai][linkedin], a current student at [Dartmouth College][dartmouth].
My primary interests are in [deep learning][dl], [functional programming][functional-prg], and a _little bit_ of [design][design].
However, I love to problem-solve across a wide range of domains &mdash; as reflected in my projects &mdash;
and I am excited to learn about and work on challenging problems and discover new perspectives.

## Life Philosophy
I am originally from [Kenya][kenya]. Having grown up in a community with limited resources,
I learned resourcefulness, resilience, and a keen sense of responsibility.
These are values I carry in all my endeavors, including engineering work.
For instance, I love to iterate fast, but also acknowledge
the limitations that bootstrapped solutions might have when employed in real-world scenarios,
with _real_ impact to people's livelihoods.
I’m reciting that _quality affects all aspects of my pursuits_.
I want to imbue quality in everything I do.
This skill develops while doing.
Not thinking, not imagining, _doing_ &mdash; 
it is acquired through learning and experimenting and consistency and pacing.

## Recent Travails
Most recently, I am learning and doing research around
the applications of [deep learning][dl] in [computer vision][cv].
I also have interests and experiences in
[reinforcement learning][rl], [natural language processing][nlp],
[database systems][database-systems], [high-performance computing][hpc],
and [functional programming][functional-prg].

## What Now?
For more about myself, read on.  
If interested in something particularly, [let me know][email].
