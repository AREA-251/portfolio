# Hello There

Introducing myself is hard; I never know what to say.
It's hard to talk about myself without either feeling that I'm bragging
or feeling that I'm a failure.
Or, for the less technically inclined, boring you with
vacuous innuendos on categories and functors.

## What do I do?

In specious phrasing, I tell computers what to do.
I speak Python, Haskell, and C++ well.
My Rust is rusty :crab:, but I am working on it.
I am learning new ways of figuring out
_what_ to tell computers to do, and occasionally
help other learners pick up the whats and the hows.

Most recently, I am learning and doing research around
the applications of [deep learning][dl] in [computer vision][cv].
I also have interests and experiences in
[reinforcement learning][rl], [natural language processing][nlp],
[database systems][database-systems], [high-performance computing][hpc],
and [functional programming][functional-prg].

I'm also a hobbyist [designer][design].

I am currently a student at [Dartmouth College][dartmouth].
In the past, I have been at [Y Combinator][yc], [Carnegie Mellon University][cmu],
and [Starehe Boys' Center & School][starehe].

For more about myself, read on.  
If interested in something particularly, [let me know][email].
