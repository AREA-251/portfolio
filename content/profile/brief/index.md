My given name is [Amittai][amittai], but my preferred name ad 2022
is [Altair][altair].
I am a current student at Dartmouth College, and some would say
a wannabe software engineer. I am passionate about data and computation,
especially in the context of society and how those two can drive changes.
My interests include deep learning and everything in the AI space,
data engineering, systems, and, somehow, lately, a little bit of
web development. I am also a big fan of the [Haskell][haskell]
programming language and functional programming patterns in general.

When not coding or studying Math, I am probably sleeping,
playing online chess, shooting photos that I will never
put out into the world, or, on occasion, playing
[Assassin's Creed][assassins-creed] 
([Origins][assassins-creed-origins], anyone?).

I am most recently learning Database Systems (check out my projects section)
and Computer Vision, but I am generally looking for opportunities
to dabble in data engineering, machine learning, and/or functional programming.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
