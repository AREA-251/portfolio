My name is [Amittai][amittai],
a current student at [Dartmouth][dartmouth],
primary interested in design, functional programming, data systems engineering, and theory of computation.
I am currently learning theory of computation and computer vision.
I am also interested in abstract algebra mathematical logic, and particle physics.  
You may also find me playing chess, reading or watching sci-fi, shooting with my camera,
or playing [Assassin's Creed][assassins-creed].

I am also a minimalist.

I have been an alumni / student at:
