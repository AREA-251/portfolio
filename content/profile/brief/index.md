# About

My primary interests are in [deep learning][dl], [category theory][category-theory] and [functional programming][functional-prg], and a _little bit_ of [design][design].
However, I love to problem-solve across a wide range of domains.

I love spending time crafting things&mdash;

- [Designing and building things][archive]!
- [Writing about experiences and things I find interesting][blog].
- [Shooting photos][insta-art] sometimes.
- Making [generative art (coming soon)][art] with [p5.js][p5js].
