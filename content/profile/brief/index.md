# About

I currently work at [Instagram][instagram], the social media platform
for sane humans.
I'm also building [entendr.][entendr] in my spare time.

I seek to develop better _**interactive experiences**_ for people to cultivate
and share ideas so they can meaningfully express what brings them joy.

I am a generalist toward this goal and care deeply about **_systems_**, which form
the fundamental building blocks of our applications;
**_interaction design_**, which governs how we use and live with
computers all around us, and **_[ambient intelligence][ambient-intelligence]_**, which
enables us to interact with our environment in more natural ways.

<!-- I carry a keen sense of responsibility for my work, including:

- **Ethical and responsible data collection and warehousing.**
  :br :br
  Knowing **what to collect**, **how**, **why**, and most importantly
  **how to respect user privacy and copyright issues** where applicable
  is important. I have relevant experience and coursework in
  **data mining** and **ethics** therein.
  :br
  Proper [warehousing][data-warehouse], be it in
  [data lakes][data-lake] or **SQL**/**NoSQL**
  databases, is also critical.
  I have experience working with SQL databases (**MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**),
  NoSQL databases (**MongoDB**, **Firebase**), and
  vector databases (**Pinecone**).
  and I am working to better understand the **underlying architectures
  and implementations of SQL databases**.
  :br :br

- **Ethical analysis, interpretation and usage**.
  :br
  We are in an exciting period when the potential of
  **deep learning** methods especially [transformers][attention-paper]
  are being realized.
  I am interested in the applications
  of novel neural network architectures and ideas to real-world problems.
  I have experience working with neural networks in
  [computer vision][computer-vision], [natural language processing][nlp],
  and [reinforcement learning][reinforcement-learning].  :br :br
  **I am particularly excited to explore the interplay between these
  cutting-edge fields and data ethics.**
  :br :br

- **Presentation and use in production.**
  :br
  Research output is only useful once it can be turned into a product
  and presented to an end user. For this, one needs to
  **identify existing gaps**, **design**, and **implement**
  innovative solutions that address existing needs.
  I have experiences [designing][design] and building front-end, user-facing applications.
  I am experienced with both [React][react], [Vue][vue],
  and their proxies ([Nuxt][nuxt], [Next][next], [Astro][astro]).
  :br :br
  
- **Teaching**
  :br
  **They say the best way to learn is to teach others.**  
  At [Dartmouth][dartmouth], I got the exciting opportunity to work closely
  with multiple professors in tinkering with and teaching their
  courses, as well as holding office hours to help students debug
  their code and understand the material better.
  The courses included **Systems Engineering**,
  **Artificial Intelligence**, **Database Systems**, **Data Structures**,
  and **Fullstack Web Development**.
  :br :br

- I also have experience building systems with a focus on
  **efficiency** and **high performance** using [C][c],
  [C++][cpp], [Rust][rust], and [Haskell][haskell].
  :br :br

I am also working on some stuff I am excited about
over at [entendr][entendr] and
recently started learning [Racket][racket] because of
its [language-oriented development][lang-dev] features. -->
