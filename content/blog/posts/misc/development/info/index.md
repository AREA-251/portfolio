[^1]: Can you fully reuse this website? That is certainly not my
      intention, but if you are learning Nuxt, Vue,
      or Web Development in general,
      feel free to use this as a starting point.
      Likewise, some of the designs are inspired by
      things I saw on the internet, but I redesigned myself.

[^2]: Nuxt 2 docs offer better examples and and interactive guides,
      but obviously are not up to date with everything new Nuxt 3
      (but, generally, much of Nuxt 2 is still present in Nuxt 3
      so there's useful stuff to be got there).
